# The name of your Library as you want it formatted.
name=A Template Example Library

# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to
# compare different versions of the same Library, and check if an update is
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of
# releases you've had. NOTE: This must be parsable as an int!
version=1

# The version of your library. It usually follows semantic versioning (semver),
# which uses three numbers separated by dots: "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" (e.g., "1.0.0").
# - MAJOR: Increases when you make incompatible changes.
# - MINOR: Increases when you add new features that are backward-compatible.
# - PATCH: Increases when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.
# You can update these numbers as you release new versions of your library.
prettyVersion = "1.0.0"

# List of authors. Links can be provided using the syntax [author name](url).
authors=[Your Name](https://myDomain.com)

# A web page for your Library, NOT a direct link to where to download it.
url=https://myDomain.com/myLibrary

# The category (or categories) of your Library, must be from the following list:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"          
#   "Fabrication"   "Geometry"      "GUI"               "Hardware"      
#   "I/O"           "Language"      "Math"              "Simulation"    
#   "Sound"         "Utilities"     "Typography"        "Video & Vision"
# 
# If a value other than those listed is used, your Library will listed as 
# "Other". Many categories must be comma-separated.
categories=Other

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the Library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the Library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your Library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a Library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.
sentence=This description shows in the Contribution Manager and website.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your Library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph=

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)

# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your Library.
# Note that these fields use the revision and not the version of Processing, 
# parsable as an int. For example, the revision number for 4.2 is 1292. 
# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your Library is known to 
# break in a later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.
minRevision=0
maxRevision=0
