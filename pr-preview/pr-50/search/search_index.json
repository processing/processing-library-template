Dependencies added with <code>compileOnly</code>, such as Processing core, are available for compilation, but won't be included in the release.</p> <p>After you add these dependencies, refresh Gradle, and then you will be able to access them in your code.

The name can only contain     lower case alphanumeric characters, and \"-\".      This value is used by Gradle to name the built jar file, and the zip file holding     your release artifacts. If this name does not match the name of the library in your code,      as discussed in the section Developing the library,     Processing will not find your library.</li> <li>Edit the variable <code>group</code> with your own domain or organization name. The group id      of your library uniquely identifies your project. It's often written in reverse domain name      notation. For example, if your website is \"myDomain.com\", your group ID would be      \"com.myDomain\". This group id should match the group id discussed in      section Developing the library.</li> <li> <p>Define the <code>version</code> of your library in <code>build.gradle.kts</code>. This value will also be     included in the release artifact <code>library.properties</code>.
